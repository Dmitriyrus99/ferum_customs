# Security Policy

All security vulnerabilities should be reported via email to [support@ferum.ru](mailto:support@ferum.ru). We will respond as soon as possible.

Please do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been investigated and patched.

## Logging

All DocTypes in the application enable the **Track Changes** option. This records every modification in the standard `Version` DocType. Significant security events are also written to the builtâ€‘in **Error Log** so that administrators can review them.
