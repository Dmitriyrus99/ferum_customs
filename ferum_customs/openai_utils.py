1. **API Key Exposure**: Ensure that the API key is not logged or exposed in any way. Consider using environment variables or a secure vault for sensitive information.
   
2. **Error Handling**: The code does not handle potential exceptions from the `openai.ChatCompletion.create` call. Wrap it in a try-except block to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

3. **Hardcoded Model Name**: The model name "gpt-4" is hardcoded. Consider passing it as a parameter to the function or using a configuration setting to allow for flexibility.

4. **Stop Sequences**: The stop sequences should be carefully chosen based on the expected output. Ensure that they do not inadvertently cut off valid responses.

5. **Type Hinting**: The return type of the function is specified as `str`, but it would be better to use `Optional[str]` if there's a possibility of returning `None` in case of an error.

6. **Magic Numbers**: The `max_tokens` value is hardcoded. Consider making it a configurable parameter.

7. **Docstring**: The docstring could be more descriptive, including details about the parameters and return values.

8. **Security**: Ensure that the input `prompt` is sanitized to prevent injection attacks or unintended behavior.

9. **Unused Import**: The import statement for `from __future__ import annotations` is unnecessary unless type hints are being used in a forward reference context.
