1. **Directory Traversal Vulnerability**: The code does not properly sanitize the `app` and `test_path` inputs, which could allow for directory traversal attacks. Use `os.path.abspath()` and validate against a base directory.
   
2. **Environment Variable Injection**: Setting `os.environ["SITE_NAME"]` directly can lead to issues if the environment variable is used elsewhere in the application. Consider using a context manager or a safer method to handle environment variables.

3. **Error Handling**: Raising a `ValueError` without catching it may cause the program to exit unexpectedly. Consider using `click.ClickException` for better integration with Click's error handling.

4. **Exit Code Handling**: Using `exit()` directly can be problematic in some contexts (e.g., when this script is imported as a module). Instead, consider returning the exit code or using `sys.exit()`.

5. **Missing Type Hint for `test_path`**: The `test_path` parameter should have a type hint for consistency and clarity.

6. **Lack of Logging**: There is no logging for the execution of tests, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring.

7. **Potential for Unhandled Exceptions**: If `pytest.main()` raises an exception, it will not be caught, leading to an unhandled exception. Consider wrapping it in a try-except block.
