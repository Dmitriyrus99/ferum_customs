+- The `attachment` field does not specify a maximum file size validation in the schema. Consider adding a validation rule to enforce the 10MB limit.
+- The `fieldtype` for `attachment` should ideally include a validation for file types to prevent uploading of potentially harmful files. Consider specifying allowed file types.
+- The `track_changes` property is set to `1`, which is good for auditing, but ensure that the system has proper access controls to prevent unauthorized changes.
