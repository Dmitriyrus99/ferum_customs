- The `db_password` is stored in plaintext, which poses a security risk. It should be encrypted or stored in a secure vault.
- The `db_name` appears to be obfuscated, but it is still a good practice to avoid using easily guessable names for databases.
- The `host_name` should not include the protocol (http://) if it is meant to be a configuration value; it should be just the domain name.
- The `maintenance_mode` and `setup_wizard_required` values are stored as integers, which may lead to confusion. It is better to use boolean values (true/false) for clarity.
