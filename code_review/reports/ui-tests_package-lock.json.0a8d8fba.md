### Review for chunk ({   "name": "ui-tests",   "version": "1.0.0",   "lockfileVersion": 3,   "requires": true,   "packages": {     "": {       "name": "ui-tests",       "version": "1.0.0",       "devDependencies": {      …)

- **Code Quality**
  - The `package-lock.json` file is excessively long and contains many dependencies that may not be necessary for the project. Consider reviewing and cleaning up unused dependencies.
  - The version of `eslint` is deprecated. Update to a supported version as per the [eslint version support](https://eslint.org/version-support).
  - The `devDependencies` section contains outdated packages. Consider updating to the latest versions to ensure compatibility and security.

- **Security**
  - Some dependencies have known vulnerabilities. Regularly check for vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` and update the affected packages.
  - The `inflight` package is deprecated and has known memory leaks. Replace it with a more reliable alternative like `lru-cache`.

- **Documentation/Maintainability**
  - There are no comments or documentation within the `package-lock.json` file. While this file is auto-generated, consider adding a README or comments in the main project files to explain the purpose of the dependencies.
  - There is no changelog or versioning strategy mentioned. Implement a changelog to track changes and updates in the project.

- **Testing**
  - There is no indication of testing frameworks or strategies in the provided snippet. Ensure that unit and E2E tests are implemented and that the testing framework is included in the `devDependencies`.

- **Environment Configuration**
  - There is no mention of using environment variables for sensitive information or configuration. Ensure that any secrets or sensitive data are managed through environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
