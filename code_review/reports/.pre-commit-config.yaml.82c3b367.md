- **Architecture**
  - The configuration does not specify any hooks related to Frappe/ERPNext specific conventions, which may lead to missing checks for DocTypes, Hooks, or workflows.

- **Code Quality**
  - The `exclude` patterns are overly complex and could be simplified for better readability.
  - The `args` for some hooks are hardcoded and may benefit from using environment variables for configuration, especially for sensitive data.

- **Testing**
  - There is no mention of unit or E2E test coverage in the configuration, which is essential for maintaining code quality.

- **Security**
  - The configuration does not include any security-related hooks that could help identify vulnerabilities in the codebase.

- **Documentation/Maintainability**
  - There are no comments explaining the purpose of each hook or the rationale behind specific configurations.
  - The changelog is not mentioned, which is important for tracking changes in the configuration over time.
