- **Security**
  - The `db_password` is marked as "REDACTED", but ensure that sensitive information is never hardcoded or logged in any way. Use environment variables or a secure vault for managing secrets.

- **Documentation/Maintainability**
  - There is no documentation or comments explaining the structure of the JSON file or its purpose. Adding a brief description at the top of the file would improve maintainability.

- **Code Quality**
  - The JSON format is valid, but consider using a more structured approach for configuration management, such as using a `.env` file or a dedicated configuration management tool.

- **Testing**
  - There are no tests associated with this configuration file. Consider implementing tests to ensure that the configuration is loaded correctly and that the application behaves as expected with the provided settings.
