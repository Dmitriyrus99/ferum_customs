- **Security**
  - The `db_password` should not be included in the backup file, even if it is redacted. Sensitive information should be handled with care and not stored in plaintext or easily accessible formats.

- **Documentation/Maintainability**
  - There is no documentation or comments explaining the structure of the JSON file or its purpose. Adding a brief description would improve maintainability.

- **Architecture**
  - The file should follow a more structured approach to configuration management, possibly using environment variables or a secure vault for sensitive data instead of a JSON file.

- **Testing**
  - There are no indications of any tests associated with the backup process or the handling of this configuration file. Implementing tests to ensure the integrity and security of the backup process would be beneficial.
