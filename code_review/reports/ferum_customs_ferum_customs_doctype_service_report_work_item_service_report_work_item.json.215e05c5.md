- **Architecture**
  - The `permissions` section only includes the "System Manager" role. Consider adding more roles to ensure proper access control for different user types.
  - The `options` field for `unit_price` and `amount` should reference a valid field in the `Company` DocType. Ensure that the `Company` DocType exists and is correctly configured.

- **Code Quality**
  - The JSON formatting is correct, but ensure that the file follows the naming conventions for DocTypes in Frappe (e.g., use lowercase and underscores).
  - Consider adding type annotations for fields to improve clarity and maintainability.

- **Testing**
  - There is no mention of unit or E2E tests for this DocType. Ensure that tests are created to validate the functionality of this DocType.

- **Security**
  - Ensure that the API functions interacting with this DocType are properly whitelisted to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Documentation/Maintainability**
  - There are no comments or documentation within the JSON file. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each field and the overall DocType.
  - A changelog entry should be created for this new DocType to track changes over time.
