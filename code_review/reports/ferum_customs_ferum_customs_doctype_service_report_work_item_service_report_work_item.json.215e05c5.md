- **Architecture**
  - The `module` field should be in lowercase to comply with Frappe conventions (e.g., `"module": "ferum_customs"`).
  - Consider adding more roles in the `permissions` section to ensure proper access control for different user roles.

- **Code Quality**
  - The JSON formatting is correct, but ensure that the file is consistently indented and follows the project's style guide.
  - Consider adding type annotations for fields where applicable, especially for `quantity` and `unit_price`.

- **Testing**
  - There is no indication of unit or E2E tests for this DocType. Ensure that tests are created to cover the functionality of this DocType.

- **Security**
  - Ensure that the API functions interacting with this DocType are properly whitelisted to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Documentation/Maintainability**
  - There are no comments or documentation within the JSON file. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each field and the overall DocType.
  - A changelog entry should be created for this new DocType to track changes in the future.
