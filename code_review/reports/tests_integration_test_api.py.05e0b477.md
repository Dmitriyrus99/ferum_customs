- **Architecture**
  - Ensure that the `api` module follows Frappe/ERPNext conventions for DocTypes and hooks.
  - Verify that the `bot_create_service_request` and `bot_get_service_requests` functions are properly defined and adhere to the expected patterns for creating and retrieving DocTypes.

- **Code Quality**
  - Add type annotations for the `api` functions if not already present.
  - Ensure that the code is formatted according to PEP 8 standards (e.g., line lengths, spacing).
  - Use environment configuration for any secrets or sensitive information if applicable.

- **Testing**
  - Ensure that there are adequate unit tests for the `api` functions being tested.
  - Consider adding more test cases to cover edge cases and error handling.

- **Security**
  - Review the `api` functions for any potential vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or improper access control.
  - Ensure that any API functions used are whitelisted and follow Frappe's security best practices.

- **Documentation/Maintainability**
  - Add docstrings to the `api` functions if they are missing.
  - Include comments in the test code to explain the purpose of each step.
  - Update the changelog if any changes are made to the API or the test cases.
